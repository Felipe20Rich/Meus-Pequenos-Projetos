## Data Cleaning  

### **Steps:**  
1. **Handling Missing Values** â€“ Removed NaN values using `dropna()` to ensure dataset completeness.  
2. **Eliminating Duplicates** â€“ Used `drop_duplicates()` to maintain data integrity.  
3. **Type Conversion** â€“ Converted columns like `year`, `duration`, and `votes` into proper numerical formats.  
4. **Feature Selection** â€“ Kept relevant columns (`title`, `rating`, `description`, `votes`) for focused analysis.  
5. **Sorting Data** â€“ Organized the DataFrame by rating (`sort_values(by='rating', ascending=False)`) to highlight top-rated titles.

## Conclusion  

Through this analysis, we gained valuable insights into the trends of popular Netflix movies and series. Here are some key findings:  

- **Short productions (under 100 minutes)** tend to have highly varied ratings, likely due to the diversity of content types (documentaries, indie films, short episodes).  
- **Medium-length productions (100-200 minutes)** generally maintain solid ratings, suggesting that audiences favor balanced storytelling durations.  
- **Long productions (200-300 minutes)** show more unpredictable ratings, highlighting the importance of pacing and narrative quality.  
- **Very long productions (over 300 minutes)** are polarizingâ€”either critically acclaimed or poorly rated, depending on how well the story sustains engagement.  

Additionally, using **machine learning techniques**, we classified and clustered movies based on features such as **duration, year, and ratings**, uncovering hidden patterns in audience preferences. The project also showcased how **data visualization** helps interpret these trends efficiently.
